# üí≠ Nietzsche Chatbot

A conversational AI that embodies Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophical voice and ideas using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

Chat with Nietzsche about philosophy, morality, religion, human nature, and more. The bot draws from 19 of his complete works to provide responses grounded in his actual writings and philosophical positions.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Phase 2 Advanced RAG System**: Multi-query retrieval + contextual compression
- **19 Complete Works**: Including *Thus Spake Zarathustra*, *Beyond Good and Evil*, *The Genealogy of Morals*, and more
- **Maximum Authenticity**: Low temperature (0.3) and explicit grounding ensure faithfulness
- **Free to Use**: Powered by Groq's free Llama 3.1 API (no cost!)
- **Source Citations**: View the exact (compressed) passages used to generate each response
- **Quality Over Speed**: Advanced pipeline trades 2-3x slower responses for significantly higher quality

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- A free Groq API key ([get one here](https://console.groq.com/))

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nietzsche-chat.git
   cd nietzsche-chat
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Get a free Groq API key**
   - Go to [https://console.groq.com/](https://console.groq.com/)
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Create an API key from the dashboard
   - Copy the API key

4. **Configure your API key**
   ```bash
   # Create the secrets file
   mkdir -p .streamlit
   cp .streamlit/secrets.toml.example .streamlit/secrets.toml
   
   # Edit .streamlit/secrets.toml and add your API key:
   # GROQ_API_KEY = "your_actual_api_key_here"
   ```

5. **Build the vector store** (one-time setup)
   ```bash
   python scripts/build_vectorstore.py
   ```
   This will:
   - Load all 19 Nietzsche texts
   - Split them into paragraph-based chunks (preserves complete thoughts)
   - Create embeddings using HuggingFace
   - Build and save a FAISS vector store
   - Takes ~2-5 minutes depending on your machine

6. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

7. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:8501` and start chatting!

## üìñ How It Works

### Phase 2 Advanced RAG Pipeline

1. **User asks a question** ‚Üí "What is the √úbermensch?"
2. **Multi-query generation** ‚Üí Question is reformulated 3-5 ways by LLM
3. **Parallel vector search** ‚Üí Each variant searches Nietzsche's works
4. **Initial retrieval** ‚Üí Top 10 passages retrieved per variant
5. **Contextual compression** ‚Üí LLM extracts only the most relevant portions
6. **Grounded generation** ‚Üí Llama 3.1 (temp=0.3) responds using compressed context
7. **Response** ‚Üí You get a highly authentic answer with source citations

### üéØ Phase 1 + 2 Enhancements (Implemented)

**Phase 1 - Core Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ **Paragraph-based chunking** - Preserves complete thoughts and arguments
- ‚úÖ **Reduced temperature (0.3)** - Less creative invention, more faithful to sources
- ‚úÖ **Explicit grounding prompt** - Model instructed to stay strictly within retrieved context
- ‚úÖ **Increased retrieval (k=6‚Üí10)** - More source material reduces reliance on pre-training

**Phase 2 - Advanced RAG:**
- ‚úÖ **Multi-query retrieval** - Reformulates questions 3-5 ways for broader coverage
- ‚úÖ **Contextual compression** - Extracts only relevant portions from 10+ documents

See [PHASE1_IMPROVEMENTS.md](PHASE1_IMPROVEMENTS.md) and [PHASE2_IMPLEMENTATION.md](PHASE2_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for detailed technical documentation.

## üéØ Usage Tips

### Good Questions to Ask

## üåê Deployment to Streamlit Community Cloud

### Option 1: Commit Vector Store (Recommended)

1. Remove `vectorstore/` from `.gitignore` if present
2. Run `python scripts/build_vectorstore.py` locally
3. Commit and push the `vectorstore/` directory to your repo
4. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud:
   - Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io/)
   - Connect your GitHub repo
   - Add your `GROQ_API_KEY` to Secrets (in app settings)
   - Deploy!

### Option 2: Build on First Run

If you don't want to commit the vector store:

1. Keep `vectorstore/` in `.gitignore`
2. Modify `app.py` to build the vector store on first run if it doesn't exist
3. Note: First load will be slower (~2-5 minutes)

### Adding Secrets to Streamlit Cloud

1. Go to your app settings on Streamlit Cloud
2. Navigate to "Secrets"
3. Add:
   ```toml
   GROQ_API_KEY = "your_groq_api_key_here"
   ```

## üí∞ Cost & Rate Limits

This project uses **Groq's free tier**:
- ‚úÖ 14,400 requests per day
- ‚úÖ 30 requests per minute
- ‚úÖ Fast inference (~500 tokens/sec)
- ‚úÖ **Completely free** for personal/demo use

Perfect for a personal chatbot or portfolio project!

## üîÆ Future Enhancements (Planned)

The project has a roadmap for even more sophisticated RAG:

### Phase 3 - Advanced Features (Planned):
- **Better embeddings** - Upgrade to all-mpnet-base-v2
- **Hybrid search** - Combine semantic + keyword (BM25)
- **Re-ranking** - Cross-encoder for precision
- **Query expansion** - Search for related philosophical concepts
