# üí≠ Nietzsche Chatbot

A conversational AI that embodies Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophical voice and ideas using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

Chat with Nietzsche about philosophy, morality, religion, human nature, and more. The bot draws from 19 of his complete works to provide responses grounded in his actual writings and philosophical positions.

## ‚ú® Features

- **RAG-Powered**: Retrieves relevant passages from Nietzsche's works to ground responses
- **19 Complete Works**: Including *Thus Spake Zarathustra*, *Beyond Good and Evil*, *The Genealogy of Morals*, and more
- **Authentic Voice**: Carefully crafted prompts to capture Nietzsche's bold, aphoristic style
- **Free to Use**: Powered by Groq's free Llama 3.1 API (no cost!)
- **Source Citations**: View the exact passages used to generate each response

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- A free Groq API key ([get one here](https://console.groq.com/))

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nietzsche-chat.git
   cd nietzsche-chat
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Get a free Groq API key**
   - Go to [https://console.groq.com/](https://console.groq.com/)

4. **Configure your API key**
   ```bash
   # Create the secrets file

   # Edit .streamlit/secrets.toml and add your API key:
   # GROQ_API_KEY = "your_actual_api_key_here"
   ```

5. **Build the vector store** (one-time setup)
   ```bash
   python scripts/build_vectorstore.py
   ```
   This will:

2. **Vector search** ‚Üí The system searches through Nietzsche's works for relevant passages
3. **Context retrieval** ‚Üí Top 4 most relevant passages are retrieved
4. **LLM generation** ‚Üí Llama 3.1 generates a response in Nietzsche's voice using these passages
5. **Response** ‚Üí You get an authentic Nietzschean answer with source citations

## üåê Deployment to Streamlit Community Cloud

### Option 1: Commit Vector Store (Recommended)

1. Remove `vectorstore/` from `.gitignore` if present
2. Run `python scripts/build_vectorstore.py` locally
3. Commit and push the `vectorstore/` directory to your repo
4. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud:
   - Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io/)
   - Connect your GitHub repo
   - Add your `GROQ_API_KEY` to Secrets (in app settings)
   - Deploy!

### Option 2: Build on First Run

If you don't want to commit the vector store:

1. Keep `vectorstore/` in `.gitignore`
2. Modify `app.py` to build the vector store on first run if it doesn't exist
3. Note: First load will be slower (~2-5 minutes)

### Adding Secrets to Streamlit Cloud

1. Go to your app settings on Streamlit Cloud
2. Navigate to "Secrets"
3. Add:
   ```toml
   GROQ_API_KEY = "your_groq_api_key_here"
   ```
