# üí≠ Nietzsche Chatbot

A conversational AI that embodies Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophical voice and ideas using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

Chat with Nietzsche about philosophy, morality, religion, human nature, and more. The bot draws from 19 of his complete works to provide responses grounded in his actual writings and philosophical positions.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Advanced RAG Pipeline**: Hybrid search, multi-query retrieval, cross-encoder re-ranking, and query expansion
- **19 Complete Works**: Including *Thus Spake Zarathustra*, *Beyond Good and Evil*, *The Genealogy of Morals*, and more
- **Authentic Responses**: Low temperature (0.3) and explicit grounding instructions ensure faithfulness to Nietzsche's actual writings
- **Free to Use**: Powered by Groq's free Llama 3.1 8B API (no cost!)
- **Source Citations**: View the exact passages from Nietzsche's works used to generate each response
- **High-Quality Embeddings**: Uses all-mpnet-base-v2 for superior semantic understanding

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- A free Groq API key ([get one here](https://console.groq.com/))

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nietzsche-chat.git
   cd nietzsche-chat
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Get a free Groq API key**
   - Go to [https://console.groq.com/](https://console.groq.com/)
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Create an API key from the dashboard
   - Copy the API key

4. **Configure your API key**
   ```bash
   # Create the secrets file
   mkdir -p .streamlit
   cp .streamlit/secrets.toml.example .streamlit/secrets.toml
   
   # Edit .streamlit/secrets.toml and add your API key:
   # GROQ_API_KEY = "your_actual_api_key_here"
   ```

5. **Build the vector store** (one-time setup)
   ```bash
   python scripts/build_vectorstore.py
   ```
   This will:
   - Load all 19 Nietzsche texts
   - Split them into paragraph-based chunks (preserves complete thoughts)
   - Create embeddings using HuggingFace
   - Build and save a FAISS vector store
   - Takes ~2-5 minutes depending on your machine

6. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

7. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:8501` and start chatting!

## üìñ How It Works

### Advanced RAG Pipeline

1. **User asks a question** ‚Üí "What is the √úbermensch?"
2. **Query expansion** ‚Üí Philosophical terms expanded to related concepts
3. **Multi-query generation** ‚Üí Question reformulated 3 ways by the LLM for broader coverage
4. **Hybrid search** ‚Üí 70% semantic (FAISS with all-mpnet-base-v2) + 30% keyword (BM25)
5. **Initial retrieval** ‚Üí Top 3 passages per query from hybrid search (with 0.7 similarity threshold)
6. **Cross-encoder re-ranking** ‚Üí Re-ranks retrieved passages by relevance using ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2
7. **Grounded generation** ‚Üí Llama 3.1 8B (temperature=0.3) generates response using only the re-ranked context
8. **Response with sources** ‚Üí Authentic answer with expandable source passages

### Key Technical Features

**Intelligent Chunking:**
- Paragraph-based text splitting preserves complete thoughts and argumentative flow
- Chunk size: 1200 characters with 150-character overlap
- Respects natural paragraph boundaries in Nietzsche's writing

**Retrieval Strategy:**
- **Hybrid search** combines semantic understanding with exact keyword matching
- **Multi-query retrieval** captures relevant passages from different perspectives
- **Cross-encoder re-ranking** ensures highest quality passages are used
- **Query expansion** helps find related philosophical concepts

**Response Quality:**
- **Low temperature (0.3)** reduces creative invention and hallucinations
- **Explicit grounding instructions** keep responses faithful to source material
- **Quality filtering** with similarity threshold ensures relevant context only
- **Source citations** allow verification of all claims

## üéØ Usage Tips

### Good Questions to Ask

- "What is the Will to Power?"
- "Why do you criticize Christianity?"
- "What is the difference between master and slave morality?"
- "Explain the concept of eternal recurrence"
- "What would you think about modern social media?"

### Conversation Tips

- Challenge Nietzsche's ideas and engage in philosophical debate
- Ask for clarification on specific concepts
- Request his views on modern topics
- Ask about specific works or passages

## üåê Deployment to Streamlit Community Cloud

### Option 1: Commit Vector Store (Recommended)

1. Remove `vectorstore/` from `.gitignore` if present
2. Run `python scripts/build_vectorstore.py` locally
3. Commit and push the `vectorstore/` directory to your repo
4. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud:
   - Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io/)
   - Connect your GitHub repo
   - Add your `GROQ_API_KEY` to Secrets (in app settings)
   - Deploy!

### Option 2: Build on First Run

If you don't want to commit the vector store:

1. Keep `vectorstore/` in `.gitignore`
2. Modify `app.py` to build the vector store on first run if it doesn't exist
3. Note: First load will be slower (~2-5 minutes)

### Adding Secrets to Streamlit Cloud

1. Go to your app settings on Streamlit Cloud
2. Navigate to "Secrets"
3. Add:
   ```toml
   GROQ_API_KEY = "your_groq_api_key_here"
   ```
